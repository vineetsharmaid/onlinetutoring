                    <p>During their own time as an IB student and IB tutor Yatharth Gulati and Pierre Bou Eid, respectively, realized that many countries were lacking when it came to good quality tutoring services for the IB. Finding this to still be true a few years later, the pair decided to set up a platform wherein IB students from anywhere in the world could get the academic assistance they need. Hence, Rostrum IB was born! Rostrum aims to be the premier tutoring destination for all students undertaking or aspiring to begin the IB curriculum. Whether it is pre-course and mid-course training, revision courses and private tutoring, Rostrum aims to groom its students to achieve the pinnacle of their academic potential.</p>

          <p>We offer in-person tutoring in many cities around the world, such as London, Geneva, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, etc., wherein highly specialized tutors teach our students in the comforts of their own home.</p>
         <h4 class="text-theme-colored">Alternatively, students can make use of our online tutoring facilities, which utilize the best technology and resources. This route offers the following benefits:</h4> 
          <ul>
                <li class="list-item"><b>-Convenient and flexible scheduling for both students and tutors</b></li>
                           
                <li class="list-item"><b>-Access to the best tutors from anywhere in the world (as many tutors provide only online services due to their global clientele)</b></li>
                          
                <li class="list-item"><b>-The possibility of revisiting lessons, as tutors can record online classes and also share handwritten notes with students</b></li>
                            
            </ul>
            <br/>
          <p>    A major advantage Rostrum’s students have with our online resources is the chance to interact with tutors and their own peers from different countries. This allows for learning across the formats and teaching approaches that different IB institutions follow, as well as a social and cultural exchange between the students. This is how Rostrum IB lives up to its mission of “Teaching beyond Borders”.</p>

        <p>Only those who have experienced the IB themselves can truly understand the challenges the students face, and comprehend how to bring them up to where they need to be. At Rostrum, we guarantee our students’ satisfaction by ensuring that they are tutored only by IB alumni who have proven their academic excellence at the university and schooling levels. We personally interview each potential tutor before bringing them on board and ensure that they have successfully completed our in-house training course before they begin offering their services to our students. And it’s not just the IB we focus on; our network of educators includes specialists in A-levels and GSCEs. Whatever your academic requirement, our tutors are fully qualified to teach all subjects at all levels and help you reach your objective.</p>
